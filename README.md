# Analysis-of-refugee-population-using-Excel.
In this project, I analyzed the refugee demographics across the world between 2017 and 2022 . The source of data is the UNHCR website- refugee statistics.

# Background of the analysis.

In recent years, due to political instability in most of the countries across the world, there has been a surge in the number of people fleeing their countries. This is a way of keeping themselves and their families safe.
This analysis is based on a dataset with information regarding refugees across the globe. Some of the columns in the dataset are country of origin, country of asylum, gender, and age.

# Questions to be answered.

1.	What is the total number of refugees over the years?
2.	What percentage refugees voluntarily repatriate?
3.	What year had the greatest number of refugees?
4.	What is the average percentage of female and male refugees?
